Guy Freeman is a data scientist who has lived in Israel, England, Hong Kong, and Israel, in that order.

At some point he got a PhD in statistics. This has been wonderfully useful, at least in finding well-renumerated and interesting work, across all areas of data science, to while away the days.

Controversially, and astoundingly, he's fine with the Oxford comma.
