A few lines of probability theory can fix it.\"\nauthor: \"Guy Freeman\"\ndate: 2026-02-23\ncategories: [python, bayesian, machine-learning, ai]\nexecute:\n  eval: false\n  echo: true\n---\n\nIn the [companion essay](/posts/agentic-ai/), I argued that LLM-based \"agents\" don't deserve the name. They have no beliefs, no uncertainty quantification, no principled way to decide whether a tool query is worth its cost. This post is the technical backing for that claim --- the mathematics and code behind [Credence](https://github.com/gfrmin/credence), the benchmark I used to test it.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nFor the philosophical argument, see [Agentic AI Is Neither Intelligent Nor an Agent](/posts/agentic-ai/).\n:::\n\n## The Problem: Every Query Has a Price\n\nA standard LangChain ReAct agent, faced with a question and four tools, will query most of them for most questions. It has no mechanism to reason about whether the next query is worth its cost. The prompt says \"be helpful\" and the agent interprets helpfulness as thoroughness.\n\nThis is fine if queries are free. They are not. Every API call costs tokens, latency, and --- in a benchmark with explicit costs --- points. The question isn't \"can this tool help me?\" but \"does the expected information gain from this tool exceed what I'm paying for it?\"\n\nAnswering that requires three things the LangChain agent lacks: a model of tool reliability that updates from experience, a way to compute the expected value of information before committing to a query, and a decision rule that compares querying against submitting or abstaining. All three are undergraduate probability theory.\n\n## Modelling Tool Reliability with Beta Distributions\n\nEach tool has a different reliability for each question category. A calculator is perfect for numerical questions and useless for everything else. A knowledge base is excellent for factual recall but expensive. We don't know these reliabilities in advance --- we learn them.\n\nThe natural model is Beta-Bernoulli. For each tool-category pair, maintain a Beta distribution over the probability that the tool returns the correct answer:\n\n$$r_{t,c} \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha_{t,c},\\, \\beta_{t,c})$$\n\nStart with $\\alpha = 1, \\beta = 1$ --- a uniform prior, total ignorance. The expected reliability is the familiar ratio:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}[r_{t,c}] = \\frac{\\alpha_{t,c}}{\\alpha_{t,c} + \\beta_{t,c}}$$\n\nAfter each question, once we know ground truth, we update. If the tool gave the correct answer, increment $\\alpha$; if wrong, increment $\\beta$. Weighted by the category posterior, so learning is distributed across categories proportionally:\n\n::: {#72917df1 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef update_reliability_table(\n    table: ReliabilityTable,\n    tool_idx: int,\n    category_posterior: CategoryPosterior,\n    tool_was_correct: bool | None,\n    forgetting: float = 1.0,\n) -> ReliabilityTable:\n    new_table = table.copy()\n    if tool_was_correct is None:\n        return new_table\n\n    params = new_table[tool_idx]\n\n    if forgetting < 1.0:\n        params[:, 0] = np.maximum(1e-10, forgetting * params[:, 0])\n        params[:, 1] = np.maximum(1e-10, forgetting * params[:, 1])\n\n    if tool_was_correct:\n        params[:, 0] += category_posterior  # increment alpha\n    else:\n        params[:, 1] += category_posterior  # increment beta\n\n    return new_table\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `forgetting` parameter ($\\lambda = 0.95$ in the drift experiments) implements exponential decay --- multiplying $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ by $\\lambda$ before each update. This prevents old observations from dominating when tool reliability changes mid-task. It's what allows the agent to notice when a tool degrades and reallocate queries to alternatives within a few questions.\n\nTwo features make this work well. First, the update is exact. No gradient descent, no approximation, no convergence check. Observe, update, done. Second, the Beta distribution naturally encodes both the estimate *and* the uncertainty. A tool with $\\text{Beta}(2, 2)$ and one with $\\text{Beta}(20, 20)$ both have expected reliability 0.5, but the agent knows it's far less certain about the first.\n\n## Bayesian Updates on Answers\n\nWhen a tool returns answer $x_j$, we need to update our beliefs about which answer is correct. The likelihood model is simple: if the tool's effective reliability is $r$, it returns the correct answer with probability $r$ and each wrong answer with probability $\\frac{1-r}{3}$:\n\n$$P(\\text{tool says } x_j \\mid \\text{true answer is } x_i, r) = \\begin{cases} r & \\text{if } i = j \\\\ \\frac{1-r}{3} & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\end{cases}$$\n\nBayes' rule gives us the posterior over answers:\n\n$$P(x_i \\mid \\text{tool says } x_j) \\propto P(\\text{tool says } x_j \\mid x_i, r) \\cdot P(x_i)$$\n\nIn code, this is a few lines of NumPy:\n\n::: {#dc28ded0 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef update_answer_posterior(\n    prior: AnswerPosterior,\n    response_idx: int,\n    r_effective: float,\n) -> AnswerPosterior:\n    n = len(prior)\n    wrong_likelihood = (1.0 - r_effective) / (n - 1)\n    likelihood = np.full(n, wrong_likelihood)\n    likelihood[response_idx] = r_effective\n    updated = prior * likelihood\n    total = updated.sum()\n    if total < 1e-10:\n        return prior.copy()\n    return updated / total\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut the effective reliability $r$ is not known exactly --- we have a distribution over it. We marginalise over category uncertainty:\n\n$$r_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum_{c} P(c \\mid \\text{question}) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[r_{t,c}]$$\n\nThe agent doesn't know which category a question belongs to either, so it maintains a category posterior that updates as tools respond. A calculator returning \"not applicable\" eliminates the numerical category. A knowledge base returning nothing shifts probability toward categories with low coverage. Every piece of information tightens every belief simultaneously.\n\n## Expected Utility: When to Answer\n\nThe scoring rule is: +10 for a correct answer, -5 for a wrong answer, 0 for abstaining. This makes the expected utility of submitting answer $x_j$:\n\n$$\\text{EU}_{\\text{submit}}(x_j) = P(x_j) \\cdot 10 + (1 - P(x_j)) \\cdot (-5) = 15 \\cdot P(x_j) - 5$$\n\nSetting $\\text{EU}_{\\text{submit}} > \\text{EU}_{\\text{abstain}} = 0$ gives a clean threshold: only submit when your best candidate has posterior probability above $\\frac{1}{3}$. Below that, the expected cost of a wrong answer outweighs the expected gain.\n\n::: {#62815a13 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef eu_submit(answer_posterior: AnswerPosterior) -> float:\n    p_best = float(np.max(answer_posterior))\n    return p_best * REWARD_CORRECT + (1.0 - p_best) * PENALTY_WRONG\n\ndef eu_abstain() -> float:\n    return REWARD_ABSTAIN\n\ndef eu_star(answer_posterior: AnswerPosterior) -> float:\n    return max(eu_submit(answer_posterior), eu_abstain())\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is why the Bayesian agent abstains sometimes. Not because it \"doesn't know\" --- that's a vibes judgement --- but because the posterior probability of its best answer falls below the decision-theoretic threshold. Abstention is a calculated choice, not a failure mode.\n\n## Value of Information: When to Query\n\nThis is the heart of the system. Before querying any tool, compute whether the expected improvement in decision quality exceeds the cost.\n\n$$\\text{VOI}(t) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\text{response}}\\left[\\max(\\text{EU}^*_{\\text{submit}},\\, \\text{EU}_{\\text{abstain}}) \\mid \\text{after response}\\right] - \\max(\\text{EU}^*_{\\text{submit}},\\, \\text{EU}_{\\text{abstain}}) \\mid \\text{current}$$\n\nIn words: what's the expected best EU *after* getting the tool's response, minus the best EU *right now*? If this gain exceeds the tool's cost, query it. If not, don't.\n\nComputing this requires enumerating possible responses. For each candidate answer the tool might return, compute the probability of that response, update the answer posterior, and evaluate the resulting EU:\n\n::: {#e158c920 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef compute_voi(\n    answer_posterior: AnswerPosterior,\n    reliability_table: ReliabilityTable,\n    tool_idx: int,\n    category_posterior: CategoryPosterior,\n    tool_config: ToolConfig,\n) -> float:\n    eu_current = eu_star(answer_posterior)\n    coverage = tool_config.coverage_by_category\n\n    p_covered = float(np.dot(category_posterior, coverage))\n    expected_eu = 0.0\n\n    if p_covered > 0:\n        cat_given_answer = update_category_posterior_on_response(\n            category_posterior, coverage, got_answer=True,\n        )\n        r_eff = effective_reliability(\n            reliability_table, tool_idx, cat_given_answer,\n        )\n\n        wrong_lik = (1.0 - r_eff) / (NUM_CANDIDATES - 1)\n        for j in range(NUM_CANDIDATES):\n            lik_j = np.where(\n                np.arange(NUM_CANDIDATES) == j, r_eff, wrong_lik,\n            )\n            p_resp_j = float(np.dot(answer_posterior, lik_j))\n            if p_resp_j > 1e-15:\n                post_j = update_answer_posterior(answer_posterior, j, r_eff)\n                expected_eu += p_covered * p_resp_j * eu_star(post_j)\n\n    expected_eu += (1.0 - p_covered) * eu_current\n\n    return max(expected_eu - eu_current, 0.0)\n```\n:::\n\n\nVOI is always non-negative (by Jensen's inequality --- you can always ignore the information). The decision to query is `VOI(t) - cost(t) > 0`. That's it. No \"should I check one more tool just in case.\" No \"better safe than sorry.\" A number that either exceeds a threshold or doesn't.\n\nThis is why the Bayesian agent averaged fewer than one tool query per question while the LangChain agent averaged over three. For most questions, after zero or one queries, the VOI of further queries dropped below their cost. The agent stopped, not because it was told to be parsimonious, but because the mathematics said further queries weren't worth it.\n\n## The Decision Loop\n\nThe full loop ties these pieces together. At each step, the agent computes the EU of submitting its best answer, the EU of abstaining, and the net VOI of each unused tool. It picks the action with the highest expected utility:\n\n::: {#1fc3db22 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef select_action(state, reliability_table, tool_configs):\n    eu_sub = eu_submit(state.answer_posterior)\n    eu_abs = eu_abstain()\n\n    best_action = Action(ActionType.ABSTAIN, eu=eu_abs)\n    if eu_sub >= eu_abs:\n        best_idx = int(np.argmax(state.answer_posterior))\n        best_action = Action(ActionType.SUBMIT, answer_idx=best_idx, eu=eu_sub)\n\n    for t_idx in range(len(tool_configs)):\n        if t_idx in state.used_tools:\n            continue\n        voi = compute_voi(\n            state.answer_posterior, reliability_table,\n            t_idx, state.category_posterior, tool_configs[t_idx],\n        )\n        net = voi - tool_configs[t_idx].cost\n        if net > best_action.eu:\n            best_action = Action(\n                ActionType.QUERY, tool_idx=t_idx, eu=net,\n            )\n\n    return best_action\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe loop terminates when the best action is submitting or abstaining --- when no tool query has a net VOI exceeding the current best option. This is *convergent by construction*: each query either improves the posterior enough to justify its cost, or the agent stops. No maximum iteration count, no hardcoded \"query at most N tools.\" The mathematics decides.\n\n## What the Numbers Show\n\nThe benchmark runs 50 multiple-choice questions with four tools of varying cost and reliability. The results from the essay bear repeating with the mechanism made explicit:\n\n| Agent | Accuracy | Score | Tools/Question |\n|-------|----------|-------|----------------|\n| Bayesian | 59.6% | +112.6 | ~1.0 |\n| LangChain ReAct | 63.7% | -8.0 | 3.22 |\n| LangChain Enhanced | 66.0% | -68.2 | 3.94 |\n| Random | 25.0% | -72.5 | 2.0 |\n\nThe LangChain Enhanced agent --- the one with careful prompting about being selective --- performed *worse* than basic LangChain and barely beat random. The prompt told it to be careful, and it interpreted \"careful\" as \"thorough,\" querying 3.94 tools per question. More sophisticated prompting produced worse outcomes because *cost-benefit analysis is not a prompting problem*.\n\nThe Bayesian agent's lower accuracy is a feature, not a bug. It abstained on questions where its posterior confidence was too low to justify submission --- choosing 0 points over an expected loss. The LangChain agents submitted every time, racking up wrong-answer penalties on questions they should have skipped.\n\n## Adaptation Under Drift\n\nIn the drift experiment, one tool's reliability degrades mid-task. An agent that always trusts the degraded tool sees its score collapse by 69 points. The Bayesian agent's forgetting mechanism ($\\lambda = 0.95$) exponentially discounts old observations:\n\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{new}} = 0.95 \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{old}} + \\Delta\\alpha$$\n\nWithin a few questions of the degradation, the posterior shifts, the VOI calculation redirects queries to more reliable alternatives, and the score barely dips. No change-detection heuristic, no special-case logic. Just Bayes' rule with a discount factor.\n\n## What I Still Don't Know\n\nThe benchmark has 50 questions, 4 tools, and 5 categories. The VOI calculation enumerates all possible responses for each tool --- four candidates per tool, tractable here. In a production system with hundreds of endpoints, ambiguous objectives, and continuous rather than discrete responses, this enumeration explodes. Whether you can approximate the VOI cheaply enough to preserve the advantage is an open question.\n\nThere's also the question of composability. The Bayesian agent treats each tool query as independent. But real tools have correlated errors --- two endpoints hitting the same upstream database will fail together. Modelling those correlations requires moving from independent Betas to something like a Dirichlet or a full joint distribution, and the computational cost scales accordingly.\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting question: whether principled decision theory and the flexibility of language models are complementary rather than competing. A hybrid that uses Bayesian VOI to decide *whether* to call a tool, and an LLM to interpret the response, might combine the strengths of both. I haven't built that yet, but the interfaces are clean enough that it wouldn't be hard to try.\n\nCode and full results: [github.com/gfrmin/credence](https://github.com/gfrmin/credence)\n\n",
