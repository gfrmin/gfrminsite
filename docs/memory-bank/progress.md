# Progress

## What Works
- The Quarto website is functional and can be previewed locally using `quarto preview`.
- The site can be rendered to static HTML using `quarto render`.
- Existing blog posts (`bechirot` and `hanukkah-of-code`) are present and rendered correctly.
- Custom CSS is applied, as indicated by `styles.css`.
- Python dependencies are managed with `uv` and are installable.

## What's Left to Build (Initial State)
- The memory bank is currently being initialized. Future tasks will involve:
    - Adding new blog posts.
    - Implementing new interactive elements beyond what's currently available.
    - Addressing any potential performance or accessibility improvements.
    - Regular updates and maintenance based on new requirements or technologies.

## Current Status
The project is in a fully functional state as a personal data science blog. All core components are in place and operational.

## Known Issues (Initial State)
- No known issues at the time of memory bank initialization.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The initial decision to use Quarto for a data science blog seems well-supported by the current functionality and ease of content creation.
