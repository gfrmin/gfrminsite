# System Patterns

## System Architecture
This project is structured as a static website generated by Quarto. Content is written in Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files, which support embedded R and Python code for reproducible research.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Static Site Generation**: Using Quarto provides a robust framework for creating technical content with integrated code execution and rendering.
- **Reproducible Research**: Emphasis on embedding R and Python code directly into markdown files ensures that analyses are reproducible and outputs are dynamic.
- **Content Organization**: Blog posts are organized into a `posts/` directory, allowing for modular content management.
- **Custom Styling**: Utilization of `styles.css` for custom branding and layout adjustments, complementing Quarto's built-in themes.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Separation of Concerns**: Content, styles, and configuration are maintained in separate files (`.qmd`, `styles.css`, `_quarto.yml`).
- **Templating**: Quarto's templating system is used for consistent page layouts and navigation.

## Component Relationships
- `_quarto.yml`: Main configuration file that dictates website settings, navigation, and formatting.
- `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`: Core website pages.
- `posts/`: Directory containing individual blog posts, each potentially with its own `.qmd` file and associated assets.
- `styles.css`: Custom CSS applied globally to the website as defined in `_quarto.yml`.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **Content Creation**: Writing `.qmd` files with embedded code blocks for R and Python.
- **Site Generation**: Using `quarto render` to compile `.qmd` files into static HTML.
- **Development Server**: Using `quarto preview` for local development and live rendering of changes.
