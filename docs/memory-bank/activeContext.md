# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current work focus is the initialization and setup of the project's memory bank documentation. This involves consolidating existing project information into a structured format for future reference and continuity.

## Recent Changes
- Created `docs/memory-bank/` directory.
- Created `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` as foundational memory bank documents.

## Next Steps
- Complete the initial setup of the memory bank by creating `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
- Ensure all core project information from `_quarto.yml` and `README.md` is accurately captured in the memory bank.
- Verify the integrity and completeness of the newly created memory bank files.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Decided to structure the memory bank according to the specified hierarchy: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Prioritized extracting information directly from existing project files (`_quarto.yml`, `README.md`) to ensure accuracy.

## Learnings and Project Insights (Initial)
- The project is a Quarto-based blog focused on data science, using R and Python for analysis.
- It emphasizes reproducible research and good documentation.
