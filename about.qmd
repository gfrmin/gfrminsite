Guy Freeman is a data geek who has lived in Israel, England, Hong Kong, and Israel, in that order.

At some point he got a PhD in statistics. This has been wonderfully useful, at least in finding well-renumerated and interesting work, across all areas of data science, to while away the days. He doesn't use the title "Dr.", though, because he's not a medical doctor, thank goodness.

Controversially, and astoundingly, he's fine with the Oxford comma.
